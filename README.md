### 👩‍💻 About Me

- 🔭 I’m currently building my portfolio and working on front-end projects like a **banking system**, **movie database**, and **SA ID validation system**.  
- 🌱 I’m on an exciting journey learning **React**, sharpening my **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** skills, and leveling up my front-end expertise with **ALX Africa**.  
- 🏎️ Outside of code, I love **cars and speed** — whether it’s racing through circuits or optimizing my projects for maximum performance.  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **React or Angular projects** to continue learning and improving.  
- 🤔 I’m always looking for tips, code reviews, and resources to **boost my skills and create clean, fast, and interactive UI/UX**.  
- 💬 Ask me about: Front-end development, React, or how I turn speed-loving ideas into fast-loading apps.  
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mamikie-ronewa-maemu-a43150329?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_contact_details%3BGtaB8F5oS2G8sLKOlEc3Ig%3D%3D)  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love combining my **need for speed** with coding — like thinking of components as race cars on a track, each with its lane, speed, and performance metrics.

### 🏁 Code Scenario: Speed Meets Front-End

```Javascript
 Imagine each React component is like a race car 🏎️
 The faster and cleaner it is, the smoother the track (UI/UX experience)

function RaceTrack() {
  const cars = ["Navbar", "HeroSection", "ProjectCards", "Footer"];
  
  return (
    <div>
      {cars.map((car, index) => (
        <div key={index}>
          🚀 {car} is hitting top speed on the track!
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

 Goal: Keep every component light, fast, and high-performance.
 Just like tuning your car for peak performance on the race circuit.
 
### 🎯 My Learning Mission

I am a learner of the **ALX Software Engineering program**, and I want to revamp my GitHub profile to make it **stand out from the crowd** in my job search.  
This is why I started with **software engineering**, what I am passionate about (**building interactive, clean, and fast web experiences**) and what inspires me (**turning ideas into usable websites**).  
My aim is to **grow as a front-end developer, master React, and create UI/UX that’s both beautiful and functional**, and that’s why I would like to work on **projects that challenge me, like portfolio builds, CRUD apps, and interactive web dashboards**.
